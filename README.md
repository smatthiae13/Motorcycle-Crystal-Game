Motorcycle "Crystal Counter" Game 
Pseudocode:

This game will have 4 boxes with motorcycle images in them.
Each box will get a random number at the start of each game, which will be kept secret.
The game will create a random number at start of each game to try to add up to by clicking on different motorcycles.
On the screen it will also show the total number growing each time a motorcycle is clicked until the player either matches the random number and wins, or goes over it, and looses.
If the player wins, it will increment a win counter. if player looses, it will increment the lose counter.
Then the game will restart, and reset.
